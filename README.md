# live-color-detection ðŸŒˆ
A Python program which utilizes the user's webcam video feed to identify and isolate a specified HSV color range using OpenCV and Numpy.

## Goals:
- The user can specify what HSV color range they would like to identify.
- The program should display both a regular RGB video feed as well as a binary video feed showing only the isolated HSV range.
- The program should draw a bounding box around the isolated HSV range.

## Knowledge gained
1. Introduction to OpenCV, Numpy arrays, and Python.
2. Learning the boundingRect, waitkey, and killAllWindows CV2 functions.
3. Learning about BGR, RGB, and HSV color.
4. Introduction to computer vision.
